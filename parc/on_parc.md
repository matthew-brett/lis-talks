# Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory

* The demos - only the people doing the work saw the value.
* Competing with bean-counters
* 1979: [A visit from
  Apple](https://www.latimes.com/health/la-xpm-2011-oct-05-la-fi-jobs-legacy-hiltzik-20111006-story.html)

# Management unto death

* George Pake tires of Bob Taylor, delegates William J. Spencer to deal with
  the situation.
* Spencer: ["Taylor's not going to leave. He doesn't have anywhere to
  go."](https://asterisk.dynevor.org/fumbling-the-future.html)
* Tells Taylor to toe the line or leave.
* Taylor leaves, team leaves, game over.

> [Spencer said] “Well, you heard him. He’s left, what do you want me to do?”
And someone in the back of the room said, “Quit.” (link above).

# Themes

* Self-satisfaction tends to stasis.
* Listen to the people who are doing the work.
* Hedging bets in a fast-changing market leads to failure.
